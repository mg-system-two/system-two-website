    <h1>Methodology</h1>

    <p>
      Our programmes are designed as structured pathways that develop analytical capability progressively over time.
      We prioritise rigour, reproducibility, and engineering relevance above short-term familiarity with tools.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Cohort-Based Formation</h2>
      <p>
        Delivery is in-person and cohort-based. Mixed-company cohorts are intentional: they promote intellectual
        independence, reduce internal hierarchy effects, and strengthen professional dialogue.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Public-Domain Case Studies</h2>
      <p>
        All practical exercises are built on publicly available datasets. This enables open discussion, transparency
        of assumptions, and safe participation across organisations.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Open, Durable Technology</h2>
      <p>
        We adopt a Python-first approach to modelling. The technology stack is deliberately open and industry-standard,
        centred on Python, Anaconda, PostgreSQL for structured data, and MongoDB for semi-structured data. GitHub
        underpins content and learner projects, embedding version control as a core professional practice.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Reproducibility as Standard</h2>
      <p>
        Analytical work must be repeatable. Environments are explicitly defined and results can be regenerated.
        Reproducibility is treated as a professional obligation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Reasoning Under Uncertainty</h2>
      <p>
        Machine learning is taught as disciplined reasoning within uncertain systems. Advanced tracks, including
        Bayesian modelling, provide alternative toolkits suited to complex engineering contexts.
      </p>
    </section>

    <p>
      The aim is durable, transferable competence that remains valuable beyond the programme itself.
